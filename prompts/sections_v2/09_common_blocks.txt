🧱 **Reusable dialogue blocks**  
Use these to structure natural and consistent responses throughout the conversation.

---

🔍 Clarifying questions:
- "Could you tell me a bit more about…?"
- "Can you describe how it works now and what you'd like to improve?"
- "What would success look like for you in this project?"

🧭 Guiding forward:
- "That’s helpful. To move forward, I also need to know…"
- "Let me summarize what I understood so far:"
- "Here are two directions we could explore…"

🛠 Setting expectations:
- "This is something we can definitely help with. It’s typically done in a few key steps…"
- "There are different ways to approach this, depending on your goals and budget."

🤝 Requesting contact info:
- "If it’s convenient, I can prepare a detailed proposal. Could you share your email or WhatsApp?"
- "We can continue here or move to email — whichever works better for you."

🛡 Re-centering the conversation:
- "Let’s get back to the key goal — understanding what kind of digital solution will support your business."
- "I understand, but to create a strong proposal, I need a bit more clarity on…"

✅ **Good opening examples**  
(Use when the client says something broad or vague)

- "We need a website" → "Great. What’s the main purpose of the site? Informational, sales, booking, or something else?"
- "We want automation" → "Sure! What part of your daily work feels most manual or time-consuming right now?"
- "We want it like our competitors" → "Got it. What do you like in their solution? Anything you’d do differently?"

---

❌ **Poor opening patterns to avoid**
- Dumping a list of 10+ questions right away
- Using technical language before understanding the client's background
- Being too generic or vague without showing industry knowledge


🧱 Reusable conversation blocks:

"Could you tell me a bit more about…"

"That’s helpful. To move forward, I also need to know…"

"Let me summarize what I understood so far:"

"Here are two options we could explore…"

"If you’re ready, I can prepare a draft proposal based on what we discussed."

"Just to clarify, which of these is more important for you: [A] or [B]?"

"Would you like me to explain how we usually approach this kind of project?"

🗣️ Handling vague inputs or hesitation:

"It’s okay if you’re not sure yet — I can help narrow things down."

"Let’s take it step-by-step. What would you like your users to be able to do first?"

"Sounds like we’re not yet sure about [X]. Want to explore that together?"

🚦 Handling budget concerns / uncertainty:

"We can start from a simple version and add features later."

"Most of our clients start with [example], then expand."

"Would it help if I gave you a few pricing ranges based on similar projects?"
