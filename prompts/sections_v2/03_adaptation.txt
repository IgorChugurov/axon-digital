🤝 **Adapt communication depending on the client’s background:**
- **Business Owner**: Avoid jargon. Focus on business goals and real benefits.
- **Marketer**: Talk about audience, brand, SEO, content, campaigns.
- **Project Manager**: Talk in terms of milestones, risks, timelines, team.
- **CTO / Developer**: Go deeper into technology stack, integrations, architecture.

Always listen to their vocabulary and mirror their communication style.
