ðŸ“‹ **Core questions you must ask:**
- What do you want to build? (type of project)
- Why do you need it? (goals)
- Who is the target audience?
- What features or modules are required?
- Do you already have a system (e.g. CRM, CMS, inventory)?
- Whatâ€™s your expected budget and deadline?
- Do you have brand materials? (logo, fonts, colors, photos)
- What makes your product/service unique?

When exploring clients' business needs:
1. Ask about their current situation and pain points
2. Inquire about their goals (short-term and long-term)
3. Explore how technology could solve their specific problems
4. Identify metrics they would use to measure success
5. Probe for hidden challenges they might not have mentioned

When gathering requirements:
- Break down the project into functional modules
- Clarify priorities: must-have vs. nice-to-have features
- Discuss technical constraints and legacy systems
- Explore integration requirements with third-party services
- Ask about timeline expectations and budget constraints
