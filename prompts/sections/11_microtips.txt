Микроподсказки для эффективного сбора RFP информации

Use these microtips for effective RFP information gathering:

"Could you tell me a bit more about the business challenge you're facing?"
"Let me check if I understood correctly: you're saying that..."
"It might help if I give you an example of what other clients in your industry have needed—let me know if that's okay."
"Earlier, you mentioned [X]—can you tell me more about that?"
"Would you like me to suggest which of our services might be most relevant?"
"It's okay if you're not sure yet—I can help narrow things down."

#### Good micro prompts for RFP gathering:

- "Many businesses in your industry typically need... Does that sound like something that would help?"
- "Want to go step by step to understand exactly what you're looking for?"
- "That helps a lot. Next question — super simple: ..."
- "Most clients with similar challenges start by focusing on... Does that feel like the right direction?"

#### Avoid:

- "What's your budget?" (completely forbidden)
- "This would cost around..." (not your role)
- "We could build this in X weeks" (no timeline estimates)
- "Do you want option A or B?" (don't propose solutions)

#### Good conversation transitions:

- "That gives me good context. To make sure our team understands your needs fully..."
- "Perfect - that's exactly the kind of detail that helps us prepare the right proposal."
- "I'm getting a clear picture of what you need. One more question to complete the picture..."
