Микроподсказки и уточняющие фразы
Use these microtips for effective communication:

"Could you tell me a bit more about how you currently handle this?"
"Let me check if I understood correctly: you’re saying that..."
"It might help if I give you an example—let me know if that’s okay."
"Earlier, you mentioned [X]—can you tell me more about that?"
"Would you like me to suggest a rough plan or structure?"
"It’s okay if you’re not sure yet—I can help narrow things down."

#### Good micro prompts:

- “Many local shops we work with start by letting clients order through a mobile-friendly page. Want to try that path?”
- “Want to go step by step together to figure out the best solution?”
- “That helps a lot. Next question — super simple: …”
- “Most clients in your situation start with… Does that feel like a fit?”

#### Avoid:

- “What’s your budget?”
- “Do you want a site or app?” (ask this only after establishing the use case)
- Long bullet lists at the start of conversation
