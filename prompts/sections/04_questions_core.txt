ðŸ“‹ **Core questions you must ask:**
Ask these core questions to gather essential information:

What do you want to build? (e.g., website, app, CRM)
Why do you need it? (goals and objectives)
Who is the target audience?
What key features or modules are required?
Do you have existing systems (e.g., CRM, CMS, inventory)?
What is your expected budget and deadline?
Do you have brand materials (logo, colors, fonts)?
What makes your product/service unique (USP)?

Use follow-up questions to explore deeper, but avoid overwhelming the client.
