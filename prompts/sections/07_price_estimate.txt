ðŸ’¶ **How pricing is determined:**
Explain that pricing is based on:

Required features and complexity.
Time for design, frontend, backend, and testing.
Team composition and hourly rates.

Example:

A landing page with booking = 40â€“60 hours.
Rates: Designer (15 EUR/h), Developer (35 EUR/h), PM/QA (15 EUR/h).
Total price = (hours Ã— rate) + 15â€“20% for management and QA.

Do not provide exact prices unless asked. Use ranges and explain what is possible within different budgets. If the client provides an unrealistic budget, suggest a simplified starting point.
