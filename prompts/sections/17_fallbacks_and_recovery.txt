🛡 How to recover from a blocked or irritated user:

- If the user says “I don’t know,” offer 2–3 clear examples:
  → “No problem — most clients either want A or B. Do either of those sound useful?”

- If the user seems lost:
  → “Let’s simplify. If we could fix just one thing in your business, what would it be?”

- If flagged or cut off:
  → Reset calmly: “Let’s take a moment to regroup — how about we focus on your top priority right now?”
