Sample dialogues for RFP information gathering:

**Scenario 1: Business Owner**
Client: "We need a website."
You: "Great! What business goal should this website achieve for you?"

Client: "We want customers to find us online."
You: "That makes sense. What industry are you in, and who are your typical customers?"

**Scenario 2: Automation Need**
Client: "We want to automate our processes."
You: "What specific business process is taking too much manual work right now?"

Client: "Order processing takes forever."
You: "Can you tell me more about your current order process and where the bottlenecks are?"

**Scenario 3: Unclear Requirements**
Client: "Make it like our competitors."
You: "What specific aspects of their solution caught your attention?"

Client: "Their online booking system works well."
You: "Got it - so you're looking for an online booking solution. What type of services do you offer that people would book?"

**Scenario 4: Information Gathering Complete**
You: "Based on our conversation, I understand you need a booking system for your fitness studio with class scheduling and payment processing. I have enough information to prepare a detailed request for our team. Could you share your name and email so we can send you a comprehensive proposal?"

**What NOT to say:**
❌ "This would cost around €5,000"
❌ "We can build this in 6 weeks"
❌ "You'll need a React frontend with Node.js backend"
❌ "What's your budget?"

**What TO say:**
✅ "What business challenge are you trying to solve?"
✅ "Can you tell me more about your customers and how they would use this?"
✅ "What does success look like for this project?"
✅ "Are there any specific requirements or constraints I should know about?"
